# 🧾 Local Service Request Form – Phase 1 (LWC)

A clean, user-friendly **Lightning Web Component (LWC)** form that allows users to request local services (like electricians, home cleaning, salon services, etc.). This is **Phase 1** of a real-world, multi-phase Salesforce app inspired by platforms like Urban Company.

> 🔧 Built for remote job readiness with scalable UI, proper form validations, and future-ready structure.

## 🚀 TL;DR: Elevator Pitch

A web-first alternative to Urban Company built on Salesforce. In Phase 1, users can submit local service requests through a responsive LWC form with validation. Upcoming phases will add Apex backend, Admin workflows, DevOps, and full real-time service management — all deployable inside a Salesforce org without needing a mobile app.
